# AWS CDK App templates

A collection of starter templates for AWS CDK App projects, using [Projen](https://github.com/projen/projen/) for project generation and management. 

## Usage

Use this package together with [Projen](https://github.com/projen/projen/) to instantiate a project setup for AWS CDK, using Typescript.

For example:

```
